23539213	Identification of co-expression modules in control and CHD samples; integration with eSNPs and GWAS data revealed control-specific DM to be causal for CHD; further integration with tissue-specific Bayesian networks and PPI networks to identify Key Driver Genes	p-value
28892060	Genomic (GWAS, eQTL and cis-regulatory elements associated with IBD), transcriptomic (gene co-expression network) and clinical data from three groups of patients with IBD (treatment naive pediatric patients, patients refractory to anti-TNF therapy and patients with advanced IBD) was integrated to model the network of genes that regulate IBD. A core Immune Activation Module (IAM, a set of immune genes conserved across IBD populations) was used to build patient group specific Bayesian networks of the IBD conserved immune component (CIC) and to identify 133 key driver genes (KDGs). Genes from a macrophage-specific gene signature (MSG) were projected onto the CERTIFI IBD network (patients refractory to anti-TNF therapy) to identify a macrophage-specific component of the IBD network. 133 KDGs were identified.	1. normalised rank 2. p-value
23622250	Integration of gene-expression and genotyping data for three different brain tissues from 376 LOAD patients and 173 nondemented subjects (1,647 brain tissues in total). Disease state-specific coexpression networks were created to study differential module connectivity and functional enrichment of modules. Cis-eSNPs were used to build causal Bayesian networks for each co-expression module. Causal regulators in the top 20 modules were identified based on the number of downstream nodes and differential expression.	1. combined rank 2. NA
29802388	Data from 478 participants of Religious Order Study (ROS) and Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) (=ROSMAP), two prospective clinical-pathologic cohort studies of aging and dementia. AD pathological traits (amyloid and tau measurements), slope of cognitive decline and average expression of coexpressed gene sets detected with consensus clustering are combined using conditional independence relationships (Bayesian networks) to identify direct relationships between the three inputs. Identified 11 trait-associated modules. Module 109 (390 genes with diverse functions) directly associated with AD traits, 21 genes within m109 fulfilled several criteria to warrant follow-up (network connectivity, sufficient expression level & previous knowledge about gene function)	NA
